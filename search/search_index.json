Every variable is connected to a value, which is the information associated with that variable. In this case the value is the <code>\"Hello Python world!\"</code> text. Adding a variable makes a little more work for the Python interpreter. When it processes the first line, it associates the variable message with the <code>\"Hello Python world!\"</code> text. When it reaches the second line, it prints the value associated with message to the screen. Let\u2019s expand on this program by adding two new lines of code:</p> In\u00a0[2]: Copied! <pre>message = \"Hello Python Crash Course World!\"\nprint(message)\n</pre> message = \"Hello Python Crash Course World!\" print(message) <pre>Hello Python Crash Course World!\n</pre> <p>You can change the value of a variable in your program at any time, and Python will always keep track of its current value.</p> In\u00a0[3]: Copied! <pre>message = \"Hello Python Crash Course reader!\"\n# print(mesage)\n</pre> message = \"Hello Python Crash Course reader!\" # print(mesage) <p>When an error occurs in your program, the Python interpreter does its best to help you figure out where the problem is. The interpreter provides a traceback when a program cannot run successfully. A traceback is a record of where the interpreter ran into trouble when trying to execute your code. Here\u2019s an example of the traceback that Python provides after you\u2019ve accidentally misspelled a variable\u2019s name. Let's fix it:</p> In\u00a0[4]: Copied! <pre>mesage = \"Hello Python Crash Course reader!\"\nprint(mesage)\n</pre> mesage = \"Hello Python Crash Course reader!\" print(mesage) <pre>Hello Python Crash Course reader!\n</pre> In\u00a0[5]: Copied! <pre>name = \"ada lovelace\"\nprint(name.title())\n</pre> name = \"ada lovelace\" print(name.title()) <pre>Ada Lovelace\n</pre> <p>In this example, the variable name refers to the lowercase string \"ada lovelace\". The method title() appears after the variable in the print() call. A method is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data. The dot (.) after name in name.title() tells Python to make the title() method act on the variable name. Every method is followed by a set of parentheses, because methods often need additional information to do their work. That informa- tion is provided inside the parentheses. The title() function doesn\u2019t need any additional information, so its parentheses are empty. The title() method changes each word to title case, where each word begins with a capital letter. This is useful because you\u2019ll often want to think of a name as a piece of information. For example, you might want your pro- gram to recognize the input values Ada, ADA, and ada as the same name, and display all of them as Ada. Several other useful methods are available for dealing with case as well. For example, you can change a string to all uppercase or all lowercase letters like this:</p> In\u00a0[6]: Copied! <pre>name = \"Ada Lovelace\"\nprint(name.upper())\nprint(name.lower())\n</pre> name = \"Ada Lovelace\" print(name.upper()) print(name.lower()) <pre>ADA LOVELACE\nada lovelace\n</pre> In\u00a0[7]: Copied! <pre>first_name = \"ada\"\nlast_name = \"lovelace\"\nfull_name = f\"{first_name} {last_name}\"\nprint(full_name)\n</pre> first_name = \"ada\" last_name = \"lovelace\" full_name = f\"{first_name} {last_name}\" print(full_name) <pre>ada lovelace\n</pre> <p>To insert a variable\u2019s value into a string, place the letter f immediately before the opening quotation mark. Put braces around the name or names of any variable you want to use inside the string. Python will replace each variable with its value when the string is displayed. These strings are called f-strings. The f is for format, because Python formats the string by replacing the name of any variable in braces with its value.</p> In\u00a0[8]: Copied! <pre>first_name = \"ada\"\nlast_name = \"lovelace\"\nfull_name = f\"{first_name} {last_name}\"\nmessage = f\"Hello, {full_name.title()}!\"\nprint(message)\n</pre> first_name = \"ada\" last_name = \"lovelace\" full_name = f\"{first_name} {last_name}\" message = f\"Hello, {full_name.title()}!\" print(message) <pre>Hello, Ada Lovelace!\n</pre> In\u00a0[9]: Copied! <pre>full_name = \"{} {}\".format(first_name, last_name)\nprint(full_name)\n</pre> full_name = \"{} {}\".format(first_name, last_name) print(full_name) <pre>ada lovelace\n</pre> In\u00a0[10]: Copied! <pre>print(\"Python\")\nprint(\"\\tPython\")\n</pre> print(\"Python\") print(\"\\tPython\") <pre>Python\n\tPython\n</pre> <p>To add a newline in a string, use the character combination \\n:</p> In\u00a0[11]: Copied! <pre>print(\"Languages:\\nPython\\nC\\nJavaScript\")\n</pre> print(\"Languages:\\nPython\\nC\\nJavaScript\") <pre>Languages:\nPython\nC\nJavaScript\n</pre> <p>You can also combine tabs and newlines in a single string. The string \"\\n\\t\" tells Python to move to a new line, and start the next line with a tab. The following example shows how you can use a one-line string to generate four lines of output:</p> In\u00a0[12]: Copied! <pre>print(\"Languages:\\n\\tPython\\n\\tC\\n\\tJavaScript\")\n</pre> print(\"Languages:\\n\\tPython\\n\\tC\\n\\tJavaScript\") <pre>Languages:\n\tPython\n\tC\n\tJavaScript\n</pre> In\u00a0[13]: Copied! <pre>favorite_language = 'python '\nprint(favorite_language)\nprint(favorite_language.rstrip())\n</pre> favorite_language = 'python ' print(favorite_language) print(favorite_language.rstrip()) <pre>python \npython\n</pre> In\u00a0[14]: Copied! <pre>favorite_language = ' python '\nprint(favorite_language.rstrip())\nprint(favorite_language.lstrip())\nprint(favorite_language.strip())\n</pre> favorite_language = ' python ' print(favorite_language.rstrip()) print(favorite_language.lstrip()) print(favorite_language.strip()) <pre> python\npython \npython\n</pre> In\u00a0[15]: Copied! <pre>message = \"One of Python's strengths is its diverse community.\"\nprint(message)\n</pre> message = \"One of Python's strengths is its diverse community.\" print(message) <pre>One of Python's strengths is its diverse community.\n</pre> In\u00a0[16]: Copied! <pre># message = 'One of Python's strengths is its diverse community.'\n# print(message)\n</pre> # message = 'One of Python's strengths is its diverse community.' # print(message) In\u00a0[17]: Copied! <pre>2 + 3\n</pre> 2 + 3 Out[17]: <pre>5</pre> In\u00a0[18]: Copied! <pre>3 - 2\n</pre> 3 - 2 Out[18]: <pre>1</pre> In\u00a0[19]: Copied! <pre>2 * 3\n</pre> 2 * 3 Out[19]: <pre>6</pre> In\u00a0[20]: Copied! <pre>3 / 2\n</pre> 3 / 2 Out[20]: <pre>1.5</pre> <p>Python simply returns the result of the Python uses two multiplication symbols to represent exponents:</p> In\u00a0[21]: Copied! <pre>3 ** 2\n</pre> 3 ** 2 Out[21]: <pre>9</pre> In\u00a0[22]: Copied! <pre>3 ** 3\n</pre> 3 ** 3 Out[22]: <pre>27</pre> In\u00a0[23]: Copied! <pre>10 ** 6\n</pre> 10 ** 6 Out[23]: <pre>1000000</pre> <p>Python supports the order of operations too, so you can use multiple operations in one expression. You can also use parentheses to modify the order of operations so Python can evaluate your expression in the order you specify.

Because it stops at that second value, the output never contains the end value, which would have been 5 in this case.</p> In\u00a0[12]: Copied! <pre>for value in range(1, 6):\n    print(value)\n</pre> for value in range(1, 6):     print(value) <pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n</pre> In\u00a0[13]: Copied! <pre>numbers = list(range(1, 6))\nprint(numbers)\n</pre> numbers = list(range(1, 6)) print(numbers) <pre>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n</pre> <p>We can also use the range() function to tell Python to skip numbers in a given range. If you pass a third argument to range(), Python uses that value as a step size when generating numbers. For example, here\u2019s how to list the even numbers between 1 and 10:</p> In\u00a0[14]: Copied! <pre>even_numbers = list(range(2, 11, 2))\nprint(even_numbers)\n</pre> even_numbers = list(range(2, 11, 2)) print(even_numbers) <pre>[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n</pre> <p>You can create almost any set of numbers you want to using the range() function. For example, consider how you might make a list of the first 10 square numbers (that is, the square of each integer from 1 through 10). In Python, two asterisks (**) represent exponents. Here\u2019s how you might put the first 10 square numbers into a list:</p> In\u00a0[15]: Copied! <pre>squares = []\nfor value in range(1, 11):\n    square = value ** 2\n    squares.append(square)\nprint(squares)\n</pre> squares = [] for value in range(1, 11):     square = value ** 2     squares.append(square) print(squares) <pre>[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]\n</pre> <p>To write this code more concisely, omit the temporary variable square and append each new value directly to the list:</p> In\u00a0[16]: Copied! <pre>squares = []\nfor value in range(1,11):\n    squares.append(value**2)\nprint(squares)\n</pre> squares = [] for value in range(1,11):     squares.append(value**2) print(squares) <pre>[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]\n</pre> In\u00a0[17]: Copied! <pre>digits = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]\nmin(digits)\n</pre> digits = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0] min(digits) Out[17]: <pre>0</pre> In\u00a0[18]: Copied! <pre>max(digits)\n</pre> max(digits) Out[18]: <pre>9</pre> In\u00a0[19]: Copied! <pre>sum(digits)\n</pre> sum(digits) Out[19]: <pre>45</pre> In\u00a0[20]: Copied! <pre>squares = [value**2 for value in range(1, 11)]\nprint(squares)\n</pre> squares = [value**2 for value in range(1, 11)] print(squares) <pre>[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]\n</pre> <p>To use this syntax, begin with a descriptive name for the list, such as squares. Next, open a set of square brackets and define the expression for the values you want to store in the new list. In this example the expression is value ** 2, which raises the value to the second power. Then, write a for loop to generate the numbers you want to feed into the expression, and close the square brackets. The for loop in this example is for value in range(1, 11), which feeds the values 1 through 10 into the expression value ** 2. Notice that no colon is used at the end of the for statement.</p> In\u00a0[21]: Copied! <pre>players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']\nprint(players[0:3])\n</pre> players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli'] print(players[0:3]) <pre>['charles', 'martina', 'michael']\n</pre> In\u00a0[22]: Copied! <pre>players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']\nprint(players[1:4])\n</pre> players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli'] print(players[1:4]) <pre>['martina', 'michael', 'florence']\n</pre> <p>If you omit the first index in a slice, Python automatically starts your slice at the beginning of the list:</p> In\u00a0[23]: Copied! <pre>players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']\nprint(players[:4])\n</pre> players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli'] print(players[:4]) <pre>['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence']\n</pre> <p>A similar syntax works if you want a slice that includes the end of a list. For example, if you want all items from the third item through the last item, you can start with index 2 and omit the second index:</p> In\u00a0[24]: Copied! <pre>players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']\nprint(players[2:])\n</pre> players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli'] print(players[2:]) <pre>['michael', 'florence', 'eli']\n</pre> <p>This syntax allows you to output all of the elements from any point in your list to the end regardless of the length of the list. Recall that a negative index returns an element a certain distance from the end of a list; therefore, you can output any slice from the end of a list. For example, if we want to output the last three players on the roster, we can use the slice players[-3:]:</p> In\u00a0[25]: Copied! <pre>players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']\nprint(players[-3:])\n</pre> players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli'] print(players[-3:]) <pre>['michael', 'florence', 'eli']\n</pre> In\u00a0[26]: Copied! <pre>players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']\nprint(\"Here are the first three players on my team:\")\nfor player in players[:3]:\n    print(player.title())\n</pre> players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli'] print(\"Here are the first three players on my team:\") for player in players[:3]:     print(player.title()) <pre>Here are the first three players on my team:\nCharles\nMartina\nMichael\n</pre> In\u00a0[27]: Copied! <pre>my_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake']\nfriend_foods = my_foods[:]\nprint(\"My favorite foods are:\")\nprint(my_foods)\nprint(\"\\nMy friend's favorite foods are:\")\nprint(friend_foods)\n</pre> my_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake'] friend_foods = my_foods[:] print(\"My favorite foods are:\") print(my_foods) print(\"\\nMy friend's favorite foods are:\") print(friend_foods) <pre>My favorite foods are:\n['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake']\n\nMy friend's favorite foods are:\n['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake']\n</pre> <p>To prove that we actually have two separate lists, we\u2019ll add a new food to each list and show that each list keeps track of the appropriate person\u2019s favorite foods:</p> In\u00a0[28]: Copied! <pre>my_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake']\nfriend_foods = my_foods[:]\nmy_foods.append('cannoli')\nfriend_foods.append('ice cream')\nprint(\"My favorite foods are:\")\nprint(my_foods)\nprint(\"\\nMy friend's favorite foods are:\")\nprint(friend_foods)\n</pre> my_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake'] friend_foods = my_foods[:] my_foods.append('cannoli') friend_foods.append('ice cream') print(\"My favorite foods are:\") print(my_foods) print(\"\\nMy friend's favorite foods are:\") print(friend_foods) <pre>My favorite foods are:\n['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake', 'cannoli']\n\nMy friend's favorite foods are:\n['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake', 'ice cream']\n</pre> In\u00a0[29]: Copied! <pre>my_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake']\n# This doesn't work:\nfriend_foods = my_foods\nmy_foods.append('cannoli')\nfriend_foods.append('ice cream')\nprint(\"My favorite foods are:\")\nprint(my_foods)\nprint(\"\\nMy friend's favorite foods are:\")\nprint(friend_foods)\n</pre> my_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake'] # This doesn't work: friend_foods = my_foods my_foods.append('cannoli') friend_foods.append('ice cream') print(\"My favorite foods are:\") print(my_foods) print(\"\\nMy friend's favorite foods are:\") print(friend_foods) <pre>My favorite foods are:\n['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake', 'cannoli', 'ice cream']\n\nMy friend's favorite foods are:\n['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake', 'cannoli', 'ice cream']\n</pre> In\u00a0[30]: Copied! <pre>dimensions = (200, 50)\nprint(dimensions[0])\nprint(dimensions[1])\n</pre> dimensions = (200, 50) print(dimensions[0]) print(dimensions[1]) <pre>200\n50\n</pre> <p>Let\u2019s see what happens if we try to change one of the items in the tuple dimensions:</p> In\u00a0[31]: Copied! <pre>dimensions = (200, 50)\n# dimensions[0] = 250\n</pre> dimensions = (200, 50) # dimensions[0] = 250 <p>Tuples are technically defined by the presence of a comma; the parentheses make them look neater and more readable.

As a second optional argument, you can pass the value to be returned if the key doesn\u2019t exist:</p> In\u00a0[13]: Copied! <pre>point_value = alien_0.get('points', 'No point value assigned.')\nprint(point_value)\n</pre> point_value = alien_0.get('points', 'No point value assigned.') print(point_value) <pre>No point value assigned.\n</pre> In\u00a0[14]: Copied! <pre>user_0 = {\n    'username': 'efermi',\n    'first': 'enrico',\n    'last': 'fermi',\n    }\n</pre> user_0 = {     'username': 'efermi',     'first': 'enrico',     'last': 'fermi',     } <p>You can access any single piece of information about user_0 based on what you\u2019ve already learned in this chapter. But what if you wanted to see everything stored in this user\u2019s dictionary? To do so, you could loop through the dictionary using a for loop:</p> In\u00a0[15]: Copied! <pre>user_0 = {\n    'username': 'efermi',\n    'first': 'enrico',\n    'last': 'fermi',\n    }\n\nfor key, value in user_0.items():\n    print(f\"\\nKey: {key}\")\n    print(f\"Value: {value}\")\n</pre> user_0 = {     'username': 'efermi',     'first': 'enrico',     'last': 'fermi',     }  for key, value in user_0.items():     print(f\"\\nKey: {key}\")     print(f\"Value: {value}\") <pre>\nKey: username\nValue: efermi\n\nKey: first\nValue: enrico\n\nKey: last\nValue: fermi\n</pre> <p>As shown above, to write a for loop for a dictionary, you create names for the two variables that will hold the key and value in each key-value pair. You can choose any names you want for these two variables. This code would work just as well if you had used abbreviations for the variable names, like this:</p> <p><code>for k, v in user_0.items()</code></p> In\u00a0[16]: Copied! <pre>favorite_languages = {\n    'jen': 'python',\n    'sarah': 'c',\n    'edward': 'ruby',\n    'phil': 'python',\n    }\n\nfor name in favorite_languages.keys():\n    print(name.title())\n</pre> favorite_languages = {     'jen': 'python',     'sarah': 'c',     'edward': 'ruby',     'phil': 'python',     }  for name in favorite_languages.keys():     print(name.title()) <pre>Jen\nSarah\nEdward\nPhil\n</pre> <p>Looping through the keys is actually the default behavior when looping through a dictionary, so this code would have exactly the same output if you wrote:</p> <pre><code>for name in favorite_languages:\n</code></pre> <p>You can choose to use the keys() method explicitly if it makes your code easier to read, or you can omit it if you wish.</p> <p>You can access the value associated with any key you care about inside the loop by using the current key. Let\u2019s print a message to a couple of friends about the languages they chose.

That might work fine with a small number of values, but in a poll with a large number of respondents, this would result in a very repetitive list. To see each language chosen without repetition, we can use a set. A set is a collection in which each item must be unique:</p> In\u00a0[21]: Copied! <pre>favorite_languages = {\n    'jen': 'python',\n    'sarah': 'c',\n    'edward': 'ruby',\n    'phil': 'python',\n    }\n\nprint(\"The following languages have been mentioned:\")\nfor language in set(favorite_languages.values()):\n    print(language.title())\n</pre> favorite_languages = {     'jen': 'python',     'sarah': 'c',     'edward': 'ruby',     'phil': 'python',     }  print(\"The following languages have been mentioned:\") for language in set(favorite_languages.values()):     print(language.title()) <pre>The following languages have been mentioned:\nPython\nC\nRuby\n</pre> <p>When you wrap set() around a list that contains duplicate items, Python identifies the unique items in the list and builds a set from those items.

In this example, when Python runs the first line, the user sees the prompt Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: .

But if you try to use the input as a number, you\u2019ll get an error. We can resolve this issue by using the int() function, which tells Python to treat the input as a numerical value.

Because 1 is less than 5, Python prints 1 and then adds 1, making the current number 2. Because 2 is less than 5, Python prints 2 and adds 1 again, making the current number 3, and so on.

At message = input(prompt), Python displays the prompt and waits for the user to enter their input. Whatever they enter is assigned to message and printed; then, Python reevaluates the condition in the while statement.

You can think of None as a placeholder value. In conditional tests, None evaluates to False. If the function call includes a value for age, that value is stored in the dictionary.

Most of the code won\u2019t change; we\u2019re just making it more carefully structured.

Then, because we\u2019ve already defined our two functions, all we have to do is call them and pass them the right arguments. We call print_models() and pass it the two lists it needs; as expected, print_models() simulates printing the designs. Then we call show_completed_models() and pass it the list of completed models so it can report the models that have been printed. The descriptive function names allow others to read this code and understand it, even without comments.</p> <p>This program is easier to extend and maintain than the version without functions. If we need to print more designs later on, we can simply call print_models() again. If we realize the printing code needs to be modified, we can change the code once, and our changes will take place everywhere the function is called. This technique is more efficient than having to update code separately in several places in the program.</p> <p>This example also demonstrates the idea that every function should have one specific job. The first function prints each design, and the second displays the completed models. This is more beneficial than using one function to do both jobs. If you\u2019re writing a function and notice the function is doing too many different tasks, try to split the code into two functions. Remember that you can always call a function from another function, which can be helpful when splitting a complex task into a series of steps.</p> In\u00a0[21]: Copied! <pre>def print_models(unprinted_designs, completed_models):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulate printing each design, until none are left.\n    Move each design to completed_models after printing.\n    \"\"\"\n    while unprinted_designs:\n        current_design = unprinted_designs.pop()\n        print(f\"Printing model: {current_design}\")\n        completed_models.append(current_design)\n        \ndef show_completed_models(completed_models):\n    \"\"\"Show all the models that were printed.\"\"\"\n    print(\"\\nThe following models have been printed:\")\n    for completed_model in completed_models:\n        print(completed_model)\n        \nunprinted_designs = ['phone case', 'robot pendant', 'dodecahedron']\ncompleted_models = []\n\nprint_models(unprinted_designs[:], completed_models)\n</pre> def print_models(unprinted_designs, completed_models):     \"\"\"     Simulate printing each design, until none are left.

You\u2019ll see this structure throughout this chapter and have lots of time to get used to it. At \u278a we define a class called Dog. By convention, capitalized names refer to classes in Python. There are no parentheses in the class definition because we\u2019re creating this class from scratch. At \u278b we write a docstring describing what this class does.</p> In\u00a0[2]: Copied! <pre>my_dog = Dog('Willie', 6)\nprint(f\"My dog's name is {my_dog.name}.\")\nprint(f\"My dog is {my_dog.age} years old.\")\n</pre> my_dog = Dog('Willie', 6) print(f\"My dog's name is {my_dog.name}.\") print(f\"My dog is {my_dog.age} years old.\") <pre>My dog's name is Willie.\nMy dog is 6 years old.\n</pre> <p>The Dog class we\u2019re using here is the one we just wrote in the previous example. At \u278a we tell Python to create a dog whose name is 'Willie' and whose age is 6. When Python reads this line, it calls the <code>__init__()</code> method in Dog with the arguments 'Willie' and 6. The <code>__init__()</code> method creates an instance representing this particular dog and sets the name and age attributes using the values we provided. Python then returns an instance representing this dog. We assign that instance to the variable my_dog. The naming convention is helpful here: we can usually assume that a capitalized name like Dog refers to a class, and a lowercase name like my_dog refers to a single instance created from a class.</p> In\u00a0[3]: Copied! <pre>my_dog = Dog('Willie', 6)\nmy_dog.sit()\nmy_dog.roll_over()\n</pre> my_dog = Dog('Willie', 6) my_dog.sit() my_dog.roll_over() <pre>Willie is now sitting.\nWillie rolled over!\n</pre> <p>To call a method, give the name of the instance (in this case, my_dog) and the method you want to call, separated by a dot. When Python reads my_dog.sit(), it looks for the method sit() in the class Dog and runs that code. Python interprets the line my_dog.roll_over() in the same way.</p> <p>This syntax is quite useful. When attributes and methods have been given appropriately descriptive names like name, age, sit(), and roll_over(), we can easily infer what a block of code, even one we\u2019ve never seen before, is supposed to do.</p> In\u00a0[4]: Copied! <pre>my_dog = Dog('Willie', 6)\nyour_dog = Dog('Lucy', 3)\n\nprint(f\"My dog's name is {my_dog.name}.\")\nprint(f\"My dog is {my_dog.age} years old.\")\nmy_dog.sit()\n\nprint(f\"\\nYour dog's name is {your_dog.name}.\")\nprint(f\"Your dog is {your_dog.age} years old.\")\nyour_dog.sit()\n</pre> my_dog = Dog('Willie', 6) your_dog = Dog('Lucy', 3)  print(f\"My dog's name is {my_dog.name}.\") print(f\"My dog is {my_dog.age} years old.\") my_dog.sit()  print(f\"\\nYour dog's name is {your_dog.name}.\") print(f\"Your dog is {your_dog.age} years old.\") your_dog.sit() <pre>My dog's name is Willie.\nMy dog is 6 years old.\nWillie is now sitting.\n\nYour dog's name is Lucy.\nYour dog is 3 years old.\nLucy is now sitting.\n</pre> <p>In this example we create a dog named Willie and a dog named Lucy.

In object-oriented programming you write classes that represent real-world things and situations, and you create objects based on these classes. When you write a class, you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have. When you create individual objects from the class, each object is automatically equipped with the general behavior; you can then give each object whatever unique traits you desire. You\u2019ll be amazed how well real-world situations can be modeled with object-oriented programming.</p> <p>Making an object from a class is called instantiation, and you work with instances of a class. In this chapter you\u2019ll write classes and create instances of those classes. You\u2019ll specify the kind of information that can be stored in instances, and you\u2019ll define actions that can be taken with these instances. You\u2019ll also write classes that extend the functionality of existing classes, so similar classes can share code efficiently. You\u2019ll store your classes in modules and import classes written by other programmers into your own program files.</p> <p>Understanding object-oriented programming will help you see the world as a programmer does. It\u2019ll help you really know your code, not just what\u2019s happening line by line, but also the bigger concepts behind it.

We also know that most dogs sit and roll over. Those two pieces of information (name and age) and those two behaviors (sit and roll over) will go in our Dog class because they\u2019re common to most dogs. This class will tell Python how to make an object representing a dog.

Everything you learned about functions applies to methods as well; the only practical difference for now is the way we\u2019ll call methods. The <code>__init__()</code> method at \u278c is a special method that Python runs automatically whenever we create a new instance based on the Dog class. This method has two leading underscores and two trailing underscores, a convention that helps prevent Python\u2019s default method names from conflicting with your method names. Make sure to use two underscores on each side of <code>__init__()</code>. If you use just one on each side, the method won\u2019t be called automatically when you use your class, which can result in errors that are difficult to identify.</p> <p>We define the <code>__init__()</code> method to have three parameters: self, name, and age. The self parameter is required in the method definition, and it must come first before the other parameters. It must be included in the definition because when Python calls this method later (to create an instance of Dog), the method call will automatically pass the self argument. Every method call associated with an instance automatically passes self, which is a reference to the instance itself; it gives the individual instance access to the attributes and methods in the class. When we make an instance of Dog, Python will call the <code>__init__()</code> method from the Dog class. We\u2019ll pass Dog() a name and an age as arguments; self is passed automatically, so we don\u2019t need to pass it. Whenever we want to make an instance from the Dog class, we\u2019ll provide values for only the last two parameters, name and age.</p> <p>The two variables defined at \u278d each have the prefix self. Any variable prefixed with self is available to every method in the class, and we\u2019ll also be able to access these variables through any instance created from the class. The line self.name = name takes the value associated with the parameter name and assigns it to the variable name, which is then attached to the instance being created. The same process happens with self.age = age. Variables that are accessible through instances like this are called attributes.</p> <p>The Dog class has two other methods defined: sit() and roll_over() \u278e. Because these methods don\u2019t need additional information to run, we just define them to have one parameter, self. The instances we create later will have access to these methods. In other words, they\u2019ll be able to sit and roll over. For now, sit() and roll_over() don\u2019t do much. They simply print a message saying the dog is sitting or rolling over. But the concept can be extended to realistic situations: if this class were part of an actual computer game, these methods would contain code to make an animated dog sit and roll over. If this class was written to control a robot, these methods would direct movements that cause a robotic dog to sit and roll over.</p>"},{"location":"lectures/09_classes/#making-an-instance-from-a-class","title":"Making an Instance from a Class\u00b6","text":"<p>Think of a class as a set of instructions for how to make an instance.

Let\u2019s start by looking at the open() function. To do any work with a file, even just printing its contents, you first need to open the file to access it. The open() function needs one argument: the name of the file you want to open. Python looks for this file in the directory where the program that\u2019s currently being executed is stored. In this example, file_reader.py is currently running, so Python looks for pi_digits.txt in the directory where file_reader.py is stored. The open() function returns an object representing the file. Here, open('pi_digits.txt') returns an object representing pi_digits.txt. Python assigns this object to file_object, which we\u2019ll work with later in the program.</p> <p>The keyword with closes the file once access to it is no longer needed. Notice how we call open() in this program but not close(). You could open and close the file by calling open() and close(), but if a bug in your program prevents the close() method from being executed, the file may never close. This may seem trivial, but improperly closed files can cause data to be lost or corrupted. And if you call close() too early in your program, you\u2019ll find yourself trying to work with a closed file (a file you can\u2019t access), which leads to more errors. It\u2019s not always easy to know exactly when you should close a file, but with the structure shown here, Python will figure that out for you. All you have to do is open the file and work with it as desired, trusting that Python will close it automatically when the with block finishes execution.</p> <p>Once we have a file object representing pi_digits.txt, we use the read() method in the second line of our program to read the entire contents of the file and store it as one long string in contents. When we print the value of contents, we get the entire text file back.</p> <p>The only difference between this output and the original file is the extra blank line at the end of the output. The blank line appears because read() returns an empty string when it reaches the end of the file; this empty string shows up as a blank line. If you want to remove the extra blank line, you can use rstrip() in the call to print():</p> In\u00a0[2]: Copied! <pre>with open('data/pi_digits.txt') as file_object:\n    contents = file_object.read()\n    print(contents.rstrip())\n</pre> with open('data/pi_digits.txt') as file_object:     contents = file_object.read()     print(contents.rstrip()) <pre>3.1415926535 \n  8979323846 \n  2643383279\n</pre> In\u00a0[3]: Copied! <pre>filename = 'data/pi_digits.txt'\n\nwith open(filename) as file_object:\n    for line in file_object:\n        print(line)\n</pre> filename = 'data/pi_digits.txt'  with open(filename) as file_object:     for line in file_object:         print(line) <pre>3.1415926535 \n\n  8979323846 \n\n  2643383279\n\n</pre> <pre><code>\u278a filename = 'pi_digits.txt'\n\n\u278b with open(filename) as file_object:\n\u278c\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for line in file_object:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0print(line)\n</code></pre> <p>At \u278a we assign the name of the file we\u2019re reading from to the variable filename. This is a common convention when working with files. Because the variable filename doesn\u2019t represent the actual file\u2014it\u2019s just a string telling Python where to find the file\u2014you can easily swap out 'pi_digits.txt' for the name of another file you want to work with. After we call open(), an object representing the file and its contents is assigned to the variable file_object \u278b. We again use the with syntax to let Python open and close the file properly. To examine the file\u2019s contents, we work through each line in the file by looping over the file object \u278c.</p> <p>When we print each line, we find even more blank lines. These blank lines appear because an invisible newline character is at the end of each line in the text file. The print function adds its own newline each time we call it, so we end up with two newline characters at the end of each line: one from the file and one from print(). Using rstrip() on each line in the print() call eliminates these extra blank lines:</p> In\u00a0[4]: Copied! <pre>filename = 'data/pi_digits.txt'\n\nwith open(filename) as file_object:\n    for line in file_object:\n        print(line.rstrip())\n</pre> filename = 'data/pi_digits.txt'  with open(filename) as file_object:     for line in file_object:         print(line.rstrip()) <pre>3.1415926535\n  8979323846\n  2643383279\n</pre> In\u00a0[5]: Copied! <pre>filename = 'data/pi_digits.txt'\n\nwith open(filename) as file_object:\n    lines = file_object.readlines()\n\nfor line in lines:\n    print(line.rstrip())\n</pre> filename = 'data/pi_digits.txt'  with open(filename) as file_object:     lines = file_object.readlines()  for line in lines:     print(line.rstrip()) <pre>3.1415926535\n  8979323846\n  2643383279\n</pre> <pre><code>filename = 'data/pi_digits.txt'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0with open(filename) as file_object:\n\u278a\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0lines = file_object.readlines()\n\n\u278b for line in lines:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0print(line.rstrip())\n</code></pre> <p>At \u278a the readlines() method takes each line from the file and stores it in a list.

The first argument is still the name of the file we want to open. The second argument, 'w', tells Python that we want to open the file in write mode.

Python creates this kind of object in response to a situation where it can\u2019t do what we ask it to. When this happens, Python stops the program and tells us the kind of exception that was raised. We can use this information to modify our program. We\u2019ll tell Python what to do when this kind of exception occurs; that way, if it happens again, we\u2019re prepared.</p> In\u00a0[15]: Copied! <pre>try:\n    print(5/0)\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print(\"You can't divide by zero!\")\n</pre> try:     print(5/0) except ZeroDivisionError:     print(\"You can't divide by zero!\") <pre>You can't divide by zero!\n</pre> <p>We put print(5/0), the line that caused the error, inside a try block. If the code in a try block works, Python skips over the except block. If the code in the try block causes an error, Python looks for an except block whose error matches the one that was raised and runs the code in that block.</p> <p>In this example, the code in the try block produces a ZeroDivisionError, so Python looks for an except block telling it how to respond. Python then runs the code in that block, and the user sees a friendly error message instead of a traceback:</p> <pre><code>You can't divide by zero!\n</code></pre> <p>If more code followed the try-except block, the program would continue running because we told Python how to handle the error. Let\u2019s look at an example where catching an error can allow a program to continue running.</p> In\u00a0[16]: Copied! <pre>print(\"Give me two numbers, and I'll divide them.\")\nprint(\"Enter 'q' to quit.\")\n\n# while True:\n#     first_number = input(\"\\nFirst number: \")\n#     if first_number == 'q':\n#         break\n#     second_number = input(\"Second number: \")\n#     if second_number == 'q':\n#         break\n#     try:\n#         answer = int(first_number) / int(second_number)\n#     except ZeroDivisionError:\n#         print(\"You can't divide by 0!\")\n#     else:\n#         print(answer)\n</pre> print(\"Give me two numbers, and I'll divide them.\") print(\"Enter 'q' to quit.\")  # while True: #     first_number = input(\"\\nFirst number: \") #     if first_number == 'q': #         break #     second_number = input(\"Second number: \") #     if second_number == 'q': #         break #     try: #         answer = int(first_number) / int(second_number) #     except ZeroDivisionError: #         print(\"You can't divide by 0!\") #     else: #         print(answer) <pre>Give me two numbers, and I'll divide them.\nEnter 'q' to quit.\n</pre> <p>The try-except-else block works like this: Python attempts to run the code in the try block. The only code that should go in a try block is code that might cause an exception to be raised. Sometimes you\u2019ll have additional code that should run only if the try block was successful; this code goes in the else block. The except block tells Python what to do in case a certain exception arises when it tries to run the code in the try block. By anticipating likely sources of errors, you can write robust programs that continue to run even when they encounter invalid data and missing resources. Your code will be resistant to innocent user mistakes and malicious attacks.</p> In\u00a0[17]: Copied! <pre># filename = 'alice.txt'\n\n# with open(filename, encoding='utf-8') as f:\n#     contents = f.read()\n</pre> # filename = 'alice.txt'  # with open(filename, encoding='utf-8') as f: #     contents = f.read() <p>There are two changes here. One is the use of the variable f to represent the file object, which is a common convention. The second is the use of the encoding argument.

For example, you might store your program files in a folder called python_work; inside python_work, you might have another folder called text_files to distinguish your program files from the text files they\u2019re manipulating. Even though text_files is in python_work, just passing open() the name of a file in text_files won\u2019t work, because Python will only look in python_work and stop there; it won\u2019t go on and look in text_files. To get Python to open files from a directory other than the one where your program file is stored, you need to provide a file path, which tells Python to look in a specific location on your system.</p> <p>Because text_files is inside python_work, you could use a relative file path to open a file from text_files. A relative file path tells Python to look for a given location relative to the directory where the currently running program file is stored. For example, you\u2019d write:</p> <pre><code>with open('text_files/filename.txt') as file_object:\n</code></pre> <p>This line tells Python to look for the desired .txt file in the folder text_files and assumes that text_files is located inside python_work (which it is).</p> <p>Windows systems use a backslash () instead of a forward slash (/) when displaying file paths, but you can still *use forward slashes in your code.</p> <p>You can also tell Python exactly where the file is on your computer regardless of where the program that\u2019s being executed is stored. This is called an absolute file path. You use an absolute path if a relative path doesn\u2019t work. For instance, if you\u2019ve put text_files in some folder other than python_work\u2014say, a folder called other_files\u2014then just passing open() the path 'text_files/filename.txt' won\u2019t work because Python will only look for that location inside python_work. You\u2019ll need to write out a full path to clarify where you want Python to look.</p> <p>Absolute paths are usually longer than relative paths, so it\u2019s helpful to assign them to a variable and then pass that variable to open():</p> <pre><code>file_path = '/home/ehmatthes/other_files/text_files/filename.txt'\nwith open(file_path) as file_object:\n</code></pre> <p>Using absolute paths, you can read files from any location on your system. For now it\u2019s easiest to store files in the same directory as your program files or in a folder such as text_files within the directory that stores your program files.</p> <p>If you try to use backslashes in a file path, you\u2019ll get an error because the backslash is used to escape characters in strings. For example, in the path \"C:\\path\\to\\file.txt\", the sequence \\t is interpreted as a tab.

It is built upon a number of open-source packages, such as folium and ipyleaflet (for creating interactive maps), WhiteboxTools and whiteboxgui (for analyzing geospatial data), and ipywidgets (for designing interactive graphical user interface). The WhiteboxTools library currently contains 480+ tools for advanced geospatial analysis. Leafmap provides many convenient functions for loading and visualizing geospatial data with only one line of code. Users can also use the interactive user interface to load geospatial data without coding. Anyone with a web browser and Internet connection can use leafmap to perform geospatial analysis and data visualization in the cloud with minimal coding.
